Investing in Renewable Resources

This live portfolio contains three things:
1. Files for code that create two D3 graphs: one that shows consumption trends for renewable energy resources and one for that of non-renewable energy resources
2. A video presentation of a study design that I created with a group that depicts why we should invest more more into renewable energy resources
3. The slides for said presentation
